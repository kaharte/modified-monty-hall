Simulation of a modified Monty Hall problem.

I watched a video recently of a guy trying to explain the Monty Hall problem, but he seemed to be explaining it wrong. He took three cards, shuffled them, and then, without looking at them, put the cards face down on a table. One card was an ace, and he had someone else try to pick which one was the ace. Then *without looking at the other two cards*, he flipped over one of the other two, showed that it was not an ace, and asked if the guy wanted to change cards. 

Does it change the problem if the host selects an empty door (or, in this case, a non-ace card) without knowing whether or not it was empty beforehand? I thought it definitely did, and I made a little simulation to prove it. In this simulation, scenarios where the host accidentally reveals the correct door are tossed out.
